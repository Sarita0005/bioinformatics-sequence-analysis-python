# Genomic Sequence Analysis using Python

This project performs basic bioinformatics analysis on a genomic FASTA sequence.

## Features
- FASTA file parsing
- Nucleotide composition analysis
- GC and AT content calculation
- Codon usage analysis
- DNA to amino acid translation
- Amino acid frequency analysis
- Data visualization using Matplotlib

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
## Biological Significance
-  Codon usage bias can influence translation efficiency
-  GC content reflects genome stability and gene regulation
-  Amino acid composition provides insight into protein properties

## Input
- Genomic FASTA file (.fna)

## Output
- Amino acid frequency table (CSV)
- Amino acid frequency distribution was visualized using a bar plot, highlighting residue composition of the translated sequence.

## Purpose
This project represents foundational sequence-level bioinformatics analysis using FASTA input.
